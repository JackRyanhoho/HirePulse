# HirePulse - AI Recruiting Assistant

An intelligent recruiting assistant that uses AI to parse resumes, build a candidate knowledge graph, and provide a conversational interface for recruiters to find the best talent. This prototype demonstrates the core frontend experience.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Conversational AI Search**: Ask questions in natural language (e.g., "Find me senior developers with React experience") to instantly find the most relevant candidates.
-   **Automated Resume Ingestion**: Upload multiple resumes (PDF, DOCX) and watch as the AI automatically parses them, extracts structured data, and creates detailed candidate profiles.
-   **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Get a high-level overview of your recruiting pipeline with key stats like total candidates, active roles, and interview counts.
-   **Candidate Management**: View, sort, and filter all candidates in a centralized database. Dive deep into individual profiles to see skills, experience, and AI-extracted insights.
-   **Job & Calendar Management**: Track job openings and manage your interview schedule with an integrated calendar view.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for resume parsing and conversational search.
-   **Real-time Chat**: Agora Chat SDK (for the initial chatbot integration)

## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a frontend prototype. To run this application:

1.  Ensure you have a modern web browser.
2.  Serve the `index.html` file using a local web server.
3.  Make sure the necessary environment variables (like `API_KEY` for the Gemini API) are configured in the execution environment.
